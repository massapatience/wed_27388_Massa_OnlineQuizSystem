## The provided documents in the main branch (Phase 2 and 3) outline the design and objectives of a course management system aimed at streamlining tasks for university lecturers.
üìùHere are some insights of the whole project:
<br>
<br>



## PHASE 2: üíºBusiness Process Modeling focuses on defining and visualizing the workflow of the course management system. This phase includes:
<br>

‚ö° _**Scope**_ : Centralizing course management tasks like attendance, assignments, and grading.

üéØ _**Objectives**_ : Automate attendance tracking, simplify grading, and offer real-time performance data.

üòà _**Entities**_ : Lecturer, Course, Class, Student, Assignment, Grade, and Department, each playing a specific role in the workflow.

üòé _**Significance in MIS**_ : The system supports decision-making by giving lecturers insights into student performance, enhancing efficiency in course administration‚Äã(refernce to Phase 2.docx ).

<br>


## PHASE 3: ‚öôÔ∏èLogical Model Design provides a structured database schema for the system. Key components include:
<br>
<br>


üëå _**Entities**_ : Department, Lecturer, Course, Student, Assignment, Submission, Grade, and Attendance.

ü´Ç _**Relationships**_ : Defined using primary and foreign keys, the model connects students, lecturers, and courses to facilitate assignment submissions, grading, and attendance tracking.

üéä _**Goals**_ : Create an organized structure to support accurate and accessible data, enabling effective tracking of student progress and lecturer workload management‚Äã(reference to Phase 3.docx).

![Phase 3 (Logical model structure)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ccfcbe-81b3-4c63-a719-22a532f49ad1)


Together, these documents lay the foundation for a course management system that supports lecturers in administrative tasks and contributes to better educational outcomes.

# PHASE 4: üì° _CREATING DATABASE AND ORACLE ENTERPRISE MANAGER._

## CREATION OF A PLUGGABLE DATABASE:

 We have to create a pluggable database for our project and we name it " _**TUE_CARDINALS_COURSEMANAGEMENTSYSTEM**_ ". We created it using the following codes

 ```sql

-- Step 1: Create the Pluggable Database (PDB)

CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE tue_cardinals_CourseManagementSystem
ADMIN USER tue_cardinals IDENTIFIED BY cardinals
ROLES = (DBA)
FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('C:\app\CIOOL\product\21c\oradata\XE\pdbseed',
'C:\app\CIOOL\product\21c\oradata\XE\tue_cardinals_CourseManagementSystem/');

-- Step 2: Open the Pluggable Database

ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE tue_cardinals_CourseManagementSystem OPEN;

```
The result should be like this 

![alt text](Phase%204%20(Create%20Pluggable%20DB%20SCREENSHOT).PNG)

After this you should configure the Service Name through Net configuration assissant.

## ORACLE ENTERPRISE MANAGER:

Login with the username created and its password with the container as our pluggable database

It should give you, a homepage like this:

_For any futher information please go check on the Oracle enterprise tablespace screenshot and Oracle enterprise login screenshot._

<br>
<br>

# PHASE 5: üìù _TABLE IMPLEMENTATION AND DATA INSERTION._

## TABLE CREATION:

Here are the codes for the creation of all tables while keeping data integrity and using corresponding constraints :

```sql
-- Table department
CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT (
Department_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Contact_Details VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Table lecturer
CREATE TABLE LECTURER (
Lecturer_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Contact_Details VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
Department_ID INT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (Department_ID) REFERENCES DEPARTMENT(Department_ID)
);

-- Table course
CREATE TABLE COURSE (
Course_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Description VARCHAR(200),
Credits INT NOT NULL,
Semester INT,
Lecturer_ID INT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (Lecturer_ID) REFERENCES LECTURER(Lecturer_ID)
);

-- Table student
CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
Major VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
Year_of_study INT NOT NULL,
Department_ID INT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (Department_ID) REFERENCES DEPARTMENT(Department_ID)
);

-- Table assignment
CREATE TABLE ASSIGNMENT (
Assignment_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Course_ID INT NOT NULL,
Description VARCHAR(200),
Due_Date DATE NOT NULL,
Submission_Link VARCHAR(255),
FOREIGN KEY (Course_ID) REFERENCES COURSE(Course_ID)
);

-- Table grade
CREATE TABLE GRADE (
GRADE_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Student_ID INT NOTNULL,
Assignment_ID INT NOT NULL,
Grade_Value INT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (Student_ID) REFERENCES STUDENT(Student_ID),
FOREIGN KEY (Assignment_ID) REFERENCES ASSIGNMENT(Assignment_ID)
);

-- Table submission
CREATE TABLE SUBMISSION (
Submission_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Assignment_ID INT NOT NULL,
Student_ID INT NOT NULL,
Submission_Date DATE NOT NULL,
File_Link VARCHAR(255),
FOREIGN KEY (Assignment_ID) REFERENCES ASSIGNMENT(Assignment_ID),
FOREIGN KEY (Student_ID) REFERENCES STUDENT(Student_ID)
);

-- Table attendance
CREATE TABLE ATTENDANCE (
Attendance_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
Course_ID INT NOT NULL,
Student_ID INT NOT NULL,
Status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
Attendance_Date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
FOREIGN KEY (Course_ID) REFERENCES COURSE(Course_ID),
FOREIGN KEY (Student_ID) REFERENCES STUDENT(Student_ID)
);

```
Here are some few sample of the Tables created for futher information, I recommend you to check out  phase 5 files attached

![alt text](Phase%205%20(Desc%20Tables%20SCREENSHOT).PNG)

## DATA INSERTION:

For the purpose of keeping the readme short, we chose to use few example to demostrate the insertion of data in our Tables. 

### 1. insertion for Department Table

# PHASE 6:  üìì _DATABASE INTERACTIONS AND TRANSACTION_

## DATABASE OPERATIONS

They are many DML and DDL operations that can be than but we focus on mostly the "JOIN".

We thought and got an idea of how to make a good use of joins outside, the scope the other group would use and we thought we could use _views_ and there are the code for views:

```sql
CREATE VIEW StudentMarks AS
SELECT 
    s.Student_ID,
    s.Name AS Student_Name,
    d.Name AS Department_Name,
    a.Description AS Assignment_Description,
    su.File_Link AS Submission_Link,
    su.Submission_Date,
    g.Grade_Value
FROM 
    STUDENT s
JOIN 
    DEPARTMENT d ON s.Department_ID = d.Department_ID
LEFT JOIN 
    GRADE g ON s.Student_ID = g.Student_ID
LEFT JOIN 
    ASSIGNMENT a ON g.Assignment_ID = a.Assignment_ID
LEFT JOIN 
    SUBMISSION su ON su.Assignment_ID = a.Assignment_ID AND su.Student_ID = s.Student_ID;
```

this views will be called and it will bring the student id selected, their name, department they belong to,the assignment did and their grades.

calling the views:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM StudentMarks WHERE STUDENT_ID = 1; -- for example

```

##  Transaction Management:

Firstly, we will give a short explanation of what a transaction is :

a transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

so we chose a simple transaction and here is the following:

 ``` sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO ATTENDANCE (Attendance_ID, Course_ID, Student_ID, Status)
VALUES (26, 1, 40, 'Present');

UPDATE COURSE
SET Seats_Available = Seats_Available - 1
WHERE Course_ID = 1;

COMMIT;

```

# **Phase 7:üó≥Ô∏è Advanced Database Programming and Auditing**

This phase focuses on implementing advanced PL/SQL techniques to enhance the **Course Management System (CMS)**. These features aim to ensure system efficiency, maintain data integrity, and establish robust auditing for improved functionality and security.


## **Problem Statement**

The CMS requires advanced programming techniques to address the following challenges:  
1. Enforcing business rules and automating workflows using **triggers**.  
2. Efficient row-by-row data processing with **cursors**.  
3. Improving modularity and reusability with **packages**.  
4. Monitoring and restricting access to sensitive data using **auditing mechanisms**.


### **a) BEFORE Trigger**  
This trigger enforces validation for attendance status before data is inserted into the `ATTENDANCE` table.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER before_attendance_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON ATTENDANCE
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF :NEW.Status NOT IN ('Present', 'Absent') THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Invalid status. Must be Present or Absent.');
  END IF;
END;
/

### **b) Compound Trigger**  
This trigger ensures assignment submission deadlines are respected. It also validates that the assignment ID exists.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER submission_deadline
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON SUBMISSION
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
  due_date ASSIGNMENT.Due_Date%TYPE;
BEGIN
  SELECT Due_Date
  INTO due_date
  FROM ASSIGNMENT
  WHERE Assignment_ID = :NEW.Assignment_ID;

  IF :NEW.Submission_Date > due_date THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20002, 'Submission past the due date.');
  END IF;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20003, 'Assignment ID not found.');
END;
/

## **2. Cursor Usage**

This implementation calculates the average grade for each student using explicit cursors.

DECLARE
  CURSOR student_grades IS
    SELECT g.Student_ID, s.Name, AVG(g.Grade_Value) AS Avg_Grade
    FROM GRADE g
    JOIN STUDENT s ON g.Student_ID = s.Student_ID
    GROUP BY g.Student_ID, s.Name;

  v_student_id STUDENT.Student_ID%TYPE;
  v_student_name STUDENT.Name%TYPE;
  v_avg_grade NUMBER;
BEGIN
  OPEN student_grades;
  LOOP
    FETCH student_grades INTO v_student_id, v_student_name, v_avg_grade;
    EXIT WHEN student_grades%NOTFOUND;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Student ID: ' || v_student_id || ' | Name: ' || v_student_name || ' | Average Grade: ' || v_avg_grade);
  END LOOP;
  CLOSE student_grades;
END;
/

## **3. Attributes (%TYPE and %ROWTYPE)**

This step demonstrates the use of `%TYPE` and `%ROWTYPE` to improve efficiency and reusability in PL/SQL code.

DECLARE
  v_student_rec STUDENT%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
  SELECT * INTO v_student_rec FROM STUDENT WHERE Student_ID = 1;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Student Name: ' || v_student_rec.Name);
END;
/

## **4. Package Development**

### **a) Package Specification**  

The package specification defines reusable procedures for logging audits and updating course capacities.

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE cms_package AS
  PROCEDURE log_audit(p_table_name VARCHAR2, p_action_type VARCHAR2);
  PROCEDURE update_course_capacity(p_course_id INT);
END cms_package;
/

### **b) Package Body**  

The package body implements the procedures defined in the specification.

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY cms_package AS
  PROCEDURE log_audit(p_table_name VARCHAR2, p_action_type VARCHAR2) IS
  BEGIN
    INSERT INTO AUDIT_LOG (Table_Name, Action_Type, Changed_By, Change_Date)
    VALUES (p_table_name, p_action_type, USER, SYSDATE);
  END log_audit;

  PROCEDURE update_course_capacity(p_course_id INT) IS
  BEGIN
    UPDATE COURSE
    SET Seats_Available = Seats_Available - 1
    WHERE Course_ID = p_course_id;
  END update_course_capacity;
END cms_package;
/

## **5. Auditing and Restrictions**

### **a) Auditing Example**  
This trigger logs updates and deletions of sensitive student data into an audit log.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER audit_sensitive_data
AFTER UPDATE OR DELETE ON STUDENT
FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
  v_action_type VARCHAR2(10);
BEGIN
  IF DELETING THEN
    v_action_type := 'DELETE';
  ELSIF UPDATING THEN
    v_action_type := 'UPDATE';
  END IF;

  INSERT INTO AUDIT_LOG (Table_Name, Action_Type, Changed_By, Change_Date)
  VALUES ('STUDENT', v_action_type, USER, SYSDATE);
END;
/

### **b) Restriction Example**  
This procedure prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data based on the user's role.

BEGIN
  IF SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'SESSION_USER') != 'ADMIN_ROLE' THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20003, 'Unauthorized access.');
  END IF;
END;
/

### **Scope**  
- **Triggers**: Enforce data integrity and automate workflows.  
- **Cursors**: Enable efficient row-by-row data processing.  
- **Packages**: Group related procedures for better organization and reusability.  
- **Auditing**: Improve security and accountability by logging changes to sensitive data.
